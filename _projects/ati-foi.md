# ATI/FOI Requests

We use access to information and freedom of information laws to obtain records from government institutions about their use of technology, surveillance, and data collection.

## Our Requests

We have submitted requests to various government agencies including:

- RCMP
- CBSA
- Vancouver Police Department

## Purpose

Our FOI work helps us understand:
- How technology is being used by law enforcement
- What surveillance tools are being deployed
- How data is collected, stored, and shared
- The gaps in transparency and accountability
