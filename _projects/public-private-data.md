# Public Sector Use of Private SectorData

Coming soon. Our research into public sector use of private sector data. 

Law enforcement and national security agencies are turning to private sector data to get access to information the *Charter* would prevent them from accessing themselves.

We aim to determine:

* Which agencies are using private sector data, and what they are using it for.
* What companies are providing data to law enforcement and national security agencies, and what data they are providing.
* What circumstances allow the use of private sector data.
* What restrictions are in place to prevent its misuse.
