# Request

In August 2025, we made access to information and freedom of information requests to the Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP), Canada Border Services Agency (CBSA), and Vancouver Police Department (VPD). We [requested](https://takectrl.ca/projects/device-searches/) information on their policies and procedures for the search and seizure of electronic devices.

You'll find the information we received from the VPD under the heading "Response". We will provide summaries and analysis under the heading "Details & Analysis".

# Response

## Overview

The VPD provided a staged response:

* October 3, 2025: Two pages from its Regulation and Procedures Manual (RPM).
* November 19, 2025: A list of vendors that provide tools used by its Digital Forensic Unit and a table showing how many searches were conducted per year.

We still hope to receive technical documentation, manuals, training materials, promotional materials, contracts, and purchase orders under 2(b) of the initial request.

### October 3, 2025

The VPD provided two pages from its Regulation and Procedures Manual (RPM):

* [RPM 1.7.6(i) Seizure of Recording Equipment and/or Images at Crime Scene](/files/2025-FOI-VPD-Device-Search/RPM-1.7.6(i)-Seizure-of-Recording-Equipment.pdf)
* [RPM 1.9.19 Seizing Digital Media, Cryptocurrency, and Electronic Devices](/files/2025-FOI-VPD-Device-Search/RPM-1.9.19-Seizing-Digital-Media-Cryptocurrency-and-Electronic-Devices.pdf)

### November 19, 2025

The VPD provided a list of vendors that provide tools used by its Digital Forensics Unit (DFU):

* Cellebrite
* Magnet Forensics
* MSAB (Micro Systemation AB)
* SCG Canada
* Digital Intelligence
* Arsenal Recon
* XWays
* Final Data
* Passware
* Deepspar
* OpenText

VPD broke out its searches into three categories of search authorities:

* Judicial authorization (90%+)
* Consent (9%+)
* Coroner's Act (1%)

VPD also provided a table breaking down the number of searches conducted by DFU each year. It noted the figures provided represent the number of times a tool was used, not the number of devices. For example, a server with 3 SSDs would count as 1 entry in evidence, but would count as 3 searches in this table.

| **Year** | **Number of Searches** |
| -------- | ---------------------- |
| 2020     | 906                    |
| 2021     | 1286                   |
| 2022     | 943                    |
| 2023     | 1063                   |
| 2024     | 849                    |
| 2025     | 510 (YTD)              |

# Details & Analysis

## Regulation and Procedures Manual (RPM) Documents

The VPD RPM documents cover two types of seizures: 1) seizure of recording equipment and images at crime scenes, and 2) seizure of digital media, cryptocurrency, and electronic devices.

### Seizure of Recording Equipment or Images at Crime Scenes

Document: [RPM 1.7.6(i) Seizure of Recording Equipment and/or Images at Crime Scene](/files/2025-FOI-VPD-Device-Search/RPM-1.7.6(i)-Seizure-of-Recording-Equipment.pdf)

#### Details

Section 1.7.6(i) of the VPD RPM covers police handling of recording equipment (defined as "a device capable of capturing still images, video images, or audio recordings") belonging to media or members of the public, and the content of those devices.

The document reminds VPD members that the public has "the right to observe, photograph, and audio or video record in a public place, as long as they remain outside of police perimeters" and that the Charter right to freedom of the press means that "seizure of equipment, images or audio recordings from meda personnel will require a very high level of justification."

If a member of the public identifies themselves as media, police "shall not seize their recording equipment unless there is an imminent public safety issue involved, or there are reasonable grounds to believe the evidence will be made unavailable to police (e.g., hidden or destroyed)".

The RPM states that the Criminal Code allows police to seize recording devices if there are "exigent circumstances", including concerns that the evidence on the devices will be destroyed or that they will not be able to serve a search warrant on the owner of the device. Such seizures must be documented, along with the specific exigent circumstances that gave rise to the seizure.

Finally, if a device is seized and then returned to the owner on the scene of the incident, documenting the seizure is still required under RPM 1.9.3 (Evidence and Property Management).

#### Analysis

We appreciate the clear statement of rights of the public and of the press, but there are some gaps in this RPM:

* The public's right to record in public places includes recording the police in public places. 
* The definition of "police perimeter" should be made clear, and should not extend so far as to make the right to record meaningless. 
* "Exigent circumstances" are incredibly broad. There should be more guidance given on when it is appropriate to seize a device on the basis that evidence could be destroyed or be unavailable. 
* The "exigent circumstances" standard should be even higher when the device contains recordings of potential police misconduct. 

### Seizure of Digital Media, Cryptocurrency, and Electronic Devices
