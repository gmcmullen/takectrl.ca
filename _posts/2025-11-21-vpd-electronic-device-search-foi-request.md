In August 2025, we made access to information and freedom of information requests to the Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP), Canada Border Services Agency (CBSA), and Vancouver Police Department (VPD). We [requested](https://takectrl.ca/projects/device-searches/) information on their policies and procedures for the search and seizure of electronic devices.

T﻿his post details what we've learned from the VPD.

# Response

#﻿# Overview

The VPD provided a staged response:
- October 3, 2025: Two pages from its Regulation and Procedures Manual (RPM).
- November 19, 2025: A list of vendors that provide tools used by its Digital Forensic Unit and a table showing how many searches were conducted per year.

We still hope to receive technical documentation, manuals, training materials, promotional materials, contracts, and purchase orders under 2(b) of the initial request.

## October 3, 2025

The VPD provided two pages from its Regulation and Procedures Manual (RPM):

* [RPM 1.7.6(i) Seizure of Recording Equipment and/or Images at Crime Scene](/files/2025-FOI-VPD-Device-Search/RPM-1.7.6(i)-Seizure-of-Recording-Equipment.pdf)[](/files/2025-FOI-VPD-Device-Search/RPM-1.9.19-Seizing-Digital-Media-Cryptocurrency-and-Electronic-Devices.pdf)
* [RPM 1.9.19 Seizing Digital Media, Cryptocurrency, and Electronic Devices](/files/2025-FOI-VPD-Device-Search/RPM-1.9.19-Seizing-Digital-Media-Cryptocurrency-and-Electronic-Devices.pdf)

We will provide a summary of those documents at a later date. 

## November 19, 2025

The VPD provided a list of vendors that provide tools used by its Digital Forensics Unit (DFU):
- Cellebrite
- Magnet Forensics
- MSAB (Micro Systemation AB)
- SCG Canada
- Digital Intelligence
- Arsenal Recon
- XWays
- Final Data
- Passware
- Deepspar
- OpenText

VPD broke out its searches into three categories of search authorities:
- Judicial authorization (90%+)
- Consent (9%+)
- Coroner's Act (1%)

VPD also provided a table breaking down the number of searches conducted by DFU each year. It noted the figures provided represent the number of times a tool was used, not the number of devices. For example, a server with 3 SSDs would count as 1 entry in evidence, but would count as 3 searches in this table.

| **Year** | **Number of Searches** |
|-------|------------------------|
| 2020  |    906 |
| 2021  |   1286 |
| 2022  |    943 |
| 2023  |   1063 |
| 2024  |    849 |
| 2025  |    510 (YTD) |
